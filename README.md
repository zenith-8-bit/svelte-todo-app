# Svelte 3 Todo List App

A Todo List Application built with Svelte 3 that i made 1-2 years ago when i was initially learning svelte, here i decided to fork an existing todolist app and replace only the App.svelte [as the bulk of the changes i had made at that time was pretty simple and everything was only in one file] thus saving me bandwidth but nothing much to look in this file other than the css that i implemented

## this is an reupload of an existing project made years ago
